            <p>So, let's start with the main toxic of this server, which you need to be careful with, because it can only spread morally with words.</p>
            <p>He mainly plays solo games in the genre of racing and simulation, so if you don't have a cockpit, then don't even try to compete with it, you won't take it out.</p>
            <p>In programming, he takes the role of a developer who tries to get out in people, but so far it does not work, because he is the author of this shit site.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, he is a very kind person who is capable of talking shit, but everyone on the server will understand him and laugh (at how wretched this humor is)</p>

            <p>The main historian of this server, so don't fuck whose Crimea was there, he knows everything, he's pissed and fucked with a textbook of world history.</p>
            <p>He prefers to play various strategies, both local and large-scale (up to the universe, the size of your mom's ass).</p>
            <p>He works as a team leader in a project to develop a mobile game that will suck all your money for beer and women.</p>
            <p>And so purely a family man who prefers hot countries with Qigan apartments for 100,000,000 bucks per hour on an advance payment in cash.</p>

            <p>Something without a soul that will protect the asses of every server participant from the bottle of justice, so don't offend him, otherwise you're fucked.</p>
            <p>Fuck him knows what he's going to do there on sweaty evenings after investigating the murder of his grandfather with a thermometer, so for more information, write to him on soap.</p>
            <p>He does not know what programming is in the classical sense, but he can arrange an interrogation with a passion, after which you will want to become his alt-woman.</p>
            <p>A respectable owner of the apartment in which his roommate lives (a potential organ donor for sale to pay for accommodation and housing and communal services).</p>

            <p>The co-founder of this server, so don't fuck with him, otherwise you'll get banned for a rule that doesn't exist, but it doesn't matter.</p>
            <p>He only plays two games: warframe and Destiny 2, so all the rare skins can be found at his place. We will keep silent about percents of his life he spent there, so that you will not be disappointed.</p>
            <p>He programs unmanned aerial vehicles that can fly into your house, line up in the shape of a dick and shout loudly â€œGOYDA!".
            </p>
            <p>A Moscow man who remembers his roots from Afghanistan, so he scatters by suit and region for a foggy life (fucking vapers) and craft beer.</p>
